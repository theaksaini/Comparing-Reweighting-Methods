# Comparing-Reweighting-Methods-arxiv
Computing Sample Weights to Optimize for Fairness using Genetic Algorithm, and comparing this method against other reweighting methods.

Evolving sample weights for a given dataset and machine learning model using a Genetic Algorithm implemented in Python. Currently supports NSGA-II as the parent selection method.

Steps to produce the plots for different experimental conditions:

Execute main() in main.py an appropriate number of times. Put all output files in a folder called 'analysis.'
Run the functions in analysis_simple.ipynb to collate the results in 'hv_results' folder.
Run simple_plots.R to generate the plots.
